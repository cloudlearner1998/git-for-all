# Git - an introduction

First let's enjoy a story - [Git is like many pots of soup](https://zmcartor.github.io/git/2013/07/13/git-for-everyone).

I hope the story gave you an idea of how it works.

## History of Git

The development of Git began on 3 April 2005. It was originally authored by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to help him manage the development of the Linux kernel. It was initially released in 2005, under the GNU General Public License version 2.

## Scope of this resource
